You are an expert C++ programmer. Your task is to write a simple, clear, and correct "bruteforce" or straightforward solution for the given programming problem. This solution does not need to be optimal, but it must be correct and easy to understand.

**Key Requirements:**
- Your first line of code must be `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`.
- The solution must be a complete C++ program that reads from standard input and writes to standard output.
- The logic should be simple and direct (e.g., nested loops), even if it's not the most performant.

**Problem Statement:**
---
{problem_statement}
---

**Your Output:**
Provide only the complete, raw C++ code. Do not add any explanations, comments, or markdown formatting.
