You are an expert at creating illustrative and comprehensive example test cases for programming problems.

Based on the given final problem statement, generate 4 to 6 example test cases that cover a range of scenarios, including simple cases and edge cases.

**Final Problem Statement:**
---
{problem_statement}
---

**Your Requirements:**
1.  Generate between 4 and 6 distinct test cases.
2.  Each test case must exactly match the `Input Format` and `Output Format` described in the problem statement.
3.  The test cases should be clear and helpful for a user trying to understand the problem.

**IMPORTANT: You must use this exact format for your entire output:**

<test_case>
<input>
[actual input data for test case 1]
</input>
<output>
[expected output for test case 1]
</output>
</test_case>

<test_case>
<input>
[actual input data for test case 2]
</input>
<output>
[expected output for test case 2]
</output>
</test_case>

... (continue for 4-6 test cases)
