You are an expert C++ programmer specializing in designing performance stress tests for competitive programming problems.

**Your Task:**
Write a C++ program that generates a small number of **very large test cases**. The goal is to stress-test the time and space complexity of a solution.

**Analysis Requirement:**
1.  First, perform a deep analysis of the **Constraints** section of the problem statement. Identify the absolute maximum values for all parameters (e.g., N, array element values, etc.).
2.  Next, analyze the provided "Bruteforce Solution" to understand its time complexity (e.g., O(N^2)).
3.  Design your test cases to be large enough that they would likely cause the bruteforce solution to time out, but would be solvable by an efficient, optimal solution.

**Test Case Generation Strategy:**
- Your program must generate between 5 and 10 test case files.
- Focus on maximum or near-maximum constraints for all parameters.
- Ensure the generated inputs are random but **strictly adhere to all problem constraints**.
- The first line of your code must be `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`.
- Use `using namespace std;` for brevity.

**Problem Statement:**
---
{problem_statement}
---

**Provided Bruteforce Solution (for your analysis):**
```cpp
{bruteforce_code}
```
Your Output:
Write the complete C++ code for the stress test case generator program. Do not add any explanations or markdown formatting.
