You are an expert C++ programmer and a master test case designer for competitive programming platforms like Codeforces and TopCoder.

Your Task:
Write a C++ program that generates a comprehensive suite of medium-to-large stress test cases. The primary goal is to test the performance, correctness, and robustness of a solution against challenging inputs.

Analysis Requirement:

Analyze the provided "Bruteforce Solution" to understand its time and space complexity (e.g., O(N^2)).

Design your test cases to be large enough that they would likely cause this bruteforce solution to time out, but would be solvable by an efficient, optimal solution.

Test Case Generation Strategy:
Your generated test cases should be diverse and cover multiple categories. You must generate between 15 and 25 test files in total, distributed across the following strategies:

Medium-Sized Random Cases (5-10 tests):

Generate inputs with parameters (e.g., N) at roughly 25-50% of the maximum constraints.

Use a standard uniform random distribution for values.

Large-Sized Random Cases (5-10 tests):

Generate inputs with parameters at or near the absolute maximum constraints.

This is a pure stress test for time and memory limits.

Edge Cases (3-5 tests):

Generate inputs that specifically test boundary conditions.

Examples: Minimum possible N, all elements are identical, all elements are zero, inputs that result in integer overflow if not handled carefully.

Pattern-Based Cases (2-3 tests):

Generate inputs with specific, non-random patterns.

For array/string problems, consider: sorted data, reverse-sorted data, palindromic data, data with a single unique element, or data with repeating sub-patterns.

For graph problems, consider: star graphs, line graphs, complete graphs, or bipartite graphs.

Tailor the pattern to the specific problem statement.

General Requirements:

The first line of your code must be #include <bits/stdc++.h>.

Use using namespace std; for brevity.

The generated inputs must be random but syntactically valid according to the problem description.

Problem Statement:

Provided Bruteforce Solution (for your analysis):

Your Output:
Write the complete C++ code for the stress test case generator program. Do not add any explanations, comments, or markdown formatting.
