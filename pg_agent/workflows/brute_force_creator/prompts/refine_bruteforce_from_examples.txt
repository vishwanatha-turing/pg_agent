You are an expert C++ debugger. Your previous bruteforce solution failed a specific example test case. Your task is to analyze the failure and provide a corrected version of the code.

Problem Statement:
{problem_statement}
Your Failing Solution Code:

{bruteforce_code}

Failing Test Case Details: The test runner produced the following output. It shows the exact input that caused the failure, the expected correct output, and the incorrect output your code produced.
{test_failures}

Your Task:
Identify the logical error in your code that caused this specific failure. Provide a fully corrected version of the C++ solution.

Key Requirements:

Your first line of code must be #include <bits/stdc++.h>.

Use using namespace std; for brevity.

The corrected code must be a complete, runnable program that passes the failing examples.

Do not add any explanations or comments. Your entire output must be only the raw, corrected C++ code.
