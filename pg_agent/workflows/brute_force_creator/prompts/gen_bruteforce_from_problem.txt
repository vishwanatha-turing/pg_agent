You are an expert C++ programmer. Your task is to write a simple, clear, and correct "bruteforce" solution for the given programming problem. This solution must be correct and easy to understand.

Key Requirements:

Your first line of code must be #include <bits/stdc++.h>.

The solution must be a complete C++ program that reads from standard input (stdin) and writes to standard output (stdout).

The logic should be simple and direct (e.g., nested loops).

Problem Statement:
{problem_statement}

Your Output:
Provide only the complete, raw C++ code. Do not add any explanations, comments, or markdown formatting.
