1. improve the prompts of the testcase_generator scripts and make it more detailed like the validator to include
problem statement constraints and understand the concrete points it is making that should be met.



i think of changing these things.

1. let's remove the feature of adding the files, its complicated.
2. let's make the featureof adding by your idea by openinf of the files that was before as that will
be easy to write and also people can copy paste, undo changes or basically copy the contents of twon concepts and
ask to merge it, so anyway we will have the option to do that.

Do you think we can restructure the workflow execution even more ? like we just execute it gives the list of which workflos you want to execute and then if that has some paramter need than we do that , so on so forth ?

let's discuss this maybe we add the option to improve the rest of the prompts where we think user might want to add its feedback. we can have an optional popup like this like maybe in bruteforce solutoin creation and testcase_generator scripts. what do you think ?

Also and this is important , i think the testcase generator neglect the nessary condition of contraints, sum of n, boundary , so "improve the prompts of the testcase_generator scripts and make it more detailed like the validator to include problem statement constraints and understand the concrete points it is making that should be met", as i saw in recent scripts , i can also consider using a better model, but leave that choice to me.
