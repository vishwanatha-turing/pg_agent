Winter is coming! During the contest, your job is to place heaters to warm all the houses.
Every house can be warmed, as long as the house is within the heater's warm radius range.

You are given the positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line.
Return the minimum radius required for the heaters so that every house is covered.

Input:
- Two arrays `houses` and `heaters`, both containing unique positive integers
- 1 <= houses.length, heaters.length <= 3 * 10^4
- 1 <= houses[i], heaters[i] <= 10^9

Output:
- Integer representing the minimum radius R

Example:
Input: houses = [1,2,3], heaters = [2]
Output: 1
