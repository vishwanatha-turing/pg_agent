Below is the C++14 code that solves the problem of dividing the Kingdom by removing one road to achieve two regions with equal numbers of cities and as balanced sums of city identifiers as possible.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<int> cities(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::cin >> cities[i];
    }

    // Total sum of all city identifiers
    long long totalSum = std::accumulate(cities.begin(), cities.end(), 0LL);

    // The number of cities in each region (since n is guaranteed to be even)
    int regionSize = n / 2;

    // We need to find two regions of `regionSize` such that the sum difference is minimized
    // This can be viewed as a variation of the "Partition Problem", which is NP-complete in general.

    // Sort city identifiers
    std::sort(cities.begin(), cities.end());

    // Calculate the prefix sums
    std::vector<long long> prefixSum(n + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + cities[i];
    }

    // Minimum difference initialized to a large number
    long long minDifference = std::numeric_limits<long long>::max();

    // Try to find two subsets of size `regionSize` with minimal sum difference
    for (int i = 0; i <= n - regionSize; ++i) {
        long long sumRegion1 = prefixSum[i + regionSize] - prefixSum[i];
        long long sumRegion2 = totalSum - sumRegion1;
        long long difference = std::abs(sumRegion1 - sumRegion2);
        minDifference = std::min(minDifference, difference);
    }

    // Output the minimum difference found
    std::cout << minDifference << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Reading:** We read the number of cities `n` and the city identifiers into a vector `cities`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:** We compute prefix sums to facilitate quick sum calculations of any contiguous subarray, which is crucial given the implicit cycle structure.

3. **Region Size:** Since `n` is guaranteed even, each region must contain exactly `n/2` cities.

4. **Minimizing Difference:** We sort the city identifiers to ensure we can efficiently find balanced subsets. We then iterate through possible contiguous subarrays of size `n/2` (due to the cycle nature, any such subarray can be a potential region). For each potential split, we calculate the sum difference and track the minimum.

5. **Output:** The minimum absolute difference found is the desired result, which represents the most balanced division achievable by removing one road.

This solution efficiently handles the constraints and ensures a balanced division, leveraging sorting and prefix sums to explore potential divisions in O(n log n) time complexity.
