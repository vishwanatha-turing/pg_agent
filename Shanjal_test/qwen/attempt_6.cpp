Here's a C++ solution that solves the problem by leveraging the properties of a cycle graph and balancing the sum of city identifiers:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<int> cities(n);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::cin >> cities[i];
    }

    // Calculate the total sum of all city identifiers
    int totalSum = std::accumulate(cities.begin(), cities.end(), 0);
    
    // The target sum for each region is half of the total sum
    int targetSum = totalSum / 2;

    // Find the prefix sum that is as close to targetSum as possible
    int leftSum = 0;
    int minDifference = std::abs(totalSum - 2 * leftSum);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        leftSum += cities[i];
        int currentDifference = std::abs(totalSum - 2 * leftSum);
        minDifference = std::min(minDifference, currentDifference);
    }

    // The maximal possible sum difference between the two regions
    std::cout << minDifference << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of cities `n` and their identifiers into a vector `cities`.

2. **Total Sum Calculation**: Compute the total sum of all city identifiers to determine the target sum for each region, which is half of the total sum.

3. **Prefix Sum Approach**: Iterate over the cities to compute prefix sums. For each prefix sum, calculate the difference between the total sum and twice the prefix sum. This difference gives an idea of how balanced the two regions would be if the cycle were split at that point.

4. **Finding Minimum Difference**: Track the minimal possible difference between `totalSum` and twice the prefix sum. The result is the smallest such difference, which represents the closest we can get to balancing the two regions.

This solution efficiently calculates the required maximal possible sum difference by leveraging the properties of prefix sums and ensuring balanced regions in terms of their city identifiers.
