using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    vector<int> cities(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> cities[i];
    }
    
    // Total sum of all identifiers
    int total_sum = accumulate(cities.begin(), cities.end(), 0);

    // Sort the cities to use a two-pointer approach
    sort(cities.begin(), cities.end());

    int half_n = n / 2;
    int min_diff = INT_MAX;

    // Precompute prefix sums
    vector<int> prefix_sum(n + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + cities[i];
    }

    // Check all possible partitions
    for (int i = 0; i + half_n <= n; ++i) {
        // Sum of the current half_n cities
        int sum_first_part = prefix_sum[i + half_n] - prefix_sum[i];
        int sum_second_part = total_sum - sum_first_part;

        // Calculate the difference
        int current_diff = abs(sum_first_part - sum_second_part);
        min_diff = min(min_diff, current_diff);
    }

    cout << min_diff << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. **Input Handling**: We read the number of cities `n` and their identifiers into a vector `cities`.

2. **Total Sum Calculation**: We calculate the total sum of the city identifiers, which is useful for determining the sum of the second region when the first is known.

3. **Sorting**: We sort the city identifiers. This allows us to use a two-pointer technique to explore possible partitions of cities.

4. **Prefix Sum Precomputation**: We compute prefix sums for quick calculation of the sum of any contiguous subarray.

5. **Partition Evaluation**: We iterate over possible contiguous subarrays of size `n/2`, calculating the sum of this subarray (first region) and subtracting it from the total sum to get the sum of the second region.

6. **Difference Calculation**: For each partition, we calculate the difference in sums between the two regions and keep track of the minimum difference encountered.

7. **Output**: Finally, we print the minimal possible difference, which is the answer to the problem.

This approach efficiently finds the partition with the minimal sum difference by leveraging sorting and prefix sums to keep the time complexity manageable.
