This C++ code is designed to solve the problem of dividing the Kingdom of Paradox into two regions as described in the problem statement. The program reads the number of cities and their identifiers, calculates prefix sums to efficiently determine the sums of potential regions, and iterates over possible road removals to find the division with the smallest possible sum difference between the two regions. The result is printed as the minimal possible sum difference.
