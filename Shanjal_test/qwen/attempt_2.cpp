This C++ code reads the number of cities and their identifiers, calculates prefix sums, and systematically evaluates all possible divisions of the cycle into two regions to find the minimal possible sum difference when the regions have equal number of cities. The solution leverages prefix sums for efficient sum calculations over segments of the cities given the cycle structure. The goal is to find the minimal difference between the sums of the two regions, which reflects the best balance possible.
