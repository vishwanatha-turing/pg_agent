Write a C++ program that solves the "Two Sum" problem.
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
Input Format:
The first line contains an integer `n`, the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains `n` space-separated integers.
The third line contains the integer `target`.
Output Format:
Print the two indices (0-based) separated by a space.
